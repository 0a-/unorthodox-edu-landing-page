        <p>Explains.io is a platform for creating and sharing self-learning material (often made up of animations, pictures, and written in the most concise way possible. <a target="_blank" href="https://0a.io/0a-explains-calculus">Here is an example</a>) for pre-university curricula. We believe autodidactism is the future for education.</p>
</div>
<div class="content">
    <p>The idea is simple. Anyone can be a contributor and design self-learning material for students around the world.</p>

    <p>If you are a student and you don't like the way lessons are carried out in school but you still wish to do well in your college entrance exams (such as SAT, ACT, etc), just download our Android/iOS app and you'll be able to check out all the self-learning material available and master the subject by yourself.</p>

        <p>Our mission is to promote autodidactism and make it common among adolescents.</p>
        <p>We believe autodidactism is the key for the transition from a <b>Type I</b> education system to a <b>Type II</b> education system. </p>
        <p>The current system of public education (<b>Type I</b>) focuses mainly on the mass production of degree-holders, modeled in a way resembling that of a factory. Students are packaged into age groups and sent to a centralized manufacturing plant, often referred to as school, to "receive education".</p>
    <p class="center">

    </p>
    <p>This model of education has a long history, all the way traced back to industrial revolution. It was a golden idea at the era, but gradually we got to realize its inadequacy. One thing that is fundamentally flawed about <b>Type I</b> education is that it is based on conformity and standardization.</p>
    <p>A <b>Type II</b> education system on the other hand embraces diversity and fosters individualization. We believe by introducing the element of autodidactism to it, we can practically implement a Type II education system, economically.</p>
    <p>It would be a radical model wherein students have the freedom to do what they want, at the pace they want, under the advises and suggestions from experts in autodidactism, which they are told not to blindly follow. They can visit school at anytime -  school becomes just a place for students to seek mentorship, socialize, find collaborators for their own projects, and make friends. Depending on a student's personal preference, learning can take place mostly outside or inside school. And often they are self-directed and interest-based. A student should be living her or his life, not a "school life". In such system, motivation, instead of academic performance, is the main focus. </p>
